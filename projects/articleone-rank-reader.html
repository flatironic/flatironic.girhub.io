      ArticleOnePartners recruits public researchers to find prior art associated with patents.
      <br/><br/>
      The team that reviews submissions needed a tool to facilitate their investigation and reviewing process.
      <br/><br/>
      I was utilized mostly for concepts and prototyping of various projects at ArticleOnePartners.com
      The prior art rank reader application was a one page app that enabled submissions to be analyzed using a tag comparison tool.
      The app would display the relevant section of text for the submission and allow for the reviewer to input a status and relevant information.
      Following prototyping, I built the initial layout and contributed to the JavaScript/HTML5/CSS3/PHP development.
