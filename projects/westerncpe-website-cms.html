      An ASP.NET CMS was a requirement to work with the .NET API and commerce system. The CMS needed to be usable by non-technical
      content editors.
      <br/><br/>
      I defined and developed the infrastructure for managing the content within Umbraco with flexibility to utilize re-usable components.
      A document/template/page structure that covered four layers of page hierarchy while supporting the course catalog via API driven pages.
      <br/><br/>
      Umbraco was an excellent choice that allowed for development that centered around API services that were consumed both in
      JavaScript and Razor views. CMS content is woven into the API managed content to provide content customization on top of the
      data specific API content.
