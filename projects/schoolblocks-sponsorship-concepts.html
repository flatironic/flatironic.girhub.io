      SchoolBlocks is a CMS for schools. The sponsorship system is an idea intended to provide additional school funding with a percentage going to SchoolBlocks.<br/>

      The specifications and design for the sponsorship program needed to be defined prior to starting development.
      Examples of some of the details that needed to be defined included:
      <ul class="discs">
        <li>The process of signing sponsors up</li>
        <li>The management of sponsors by the school district and SchoolBlocks</li>
        <li>Sponsors management of their sponsorships</li>
        <li>The process of approval</li>
        <li>Sponsorship visibility on school websites</li>
        <li>Sponsor editing of their web presence</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      Using PhotoShop to create concepts and InVision to produce a prototype of the application, I was able to refine and define the design and business
      approach through collaboration and refinement.
