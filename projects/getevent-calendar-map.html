      A map version of the event calendar was a missing feature of GetEvent.
      <br/><br/>
      A RESTful API for event searching was utilized using Bootstrap and the Backbone.js framework. Backbone was used to facilitate the high degree of data binding between the map and the event list.
      The event list would repopulate when interacting with the map (unless the user opted to turn it off). Geolocation, a customized Google map, filtering for events and a responsive design
      made the tool highly usable.
      <br/><br/>
      The success of the map view for events prompted an alternative version for Event Sales which allowed for event directors to list their events for sale using the same application with
      the additional functionality of including an event sales page within the app.
