      The core pages for the GetEvent website were the event pages that contained all the information for events.
      <br/><br/>
      Utilizing Bootstrap with a focus on responsive design, these pages had an emphasis on SEO centric code design while providing a customizable interface for event directors.
      Registration details, event information, google map integration, a photo gallery, past event details, participant reviews and supporting features such as results and an event director profile
      were all included.
      <br/><br/>
      At one time (until summer of 2015), thousands of event pages existed and enabled hundreds of event directors to customization and create a web presence for their events.
