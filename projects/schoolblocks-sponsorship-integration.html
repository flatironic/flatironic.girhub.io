      Sponsorship provides subtle advertising opportunities on school websites that they can manage themselves.
      <br/><br/>
      The system to approve sponsors and create/modify their sponsorship details needed to be built. Inline editing is the style of the website,
      but the existing system needed upgrading and this was an opportunity to introduce a comprehensive inline
      editing solution.
      <br/><br/>
      Sponsors would create an account during the checkout process and build a sponsorship "card", the card was built using Bootstrap,
      Google Maps API, and the X-Editable JavaScript library. A JavaScript module was built to provide a seamless inline editing
      experience for managing the sponsorship cards using AJAX. The cards were utilized by clicking on ads, listings and both SchoolBlocks and School
      District control panels.
