      TrainingPeaks is an advanced training log for endurance athletes. As the Creative Director, I provided concepts/wireframes while still
      developing and maintaining most of their marketing website and e-commerce using ASP.NET.
      <br/><br/>
      TrainingPeaks needed a mobile solution.
      <br/><br/>
      Working with another developer, we built a service based HTML5 app that included the most relevant features of the full version of TrainingPeaks.
      The application was a one page web app that accessed iPhone features to extend the usability. Including a bar scanner to automatically
      enter nutrition data for food.
      <br/><br/>
      The foundation that was set by the JavaScript and HTML5 development for the mobile app lead the way to the rebuilding of the current browser based TrainingPeaks App.
