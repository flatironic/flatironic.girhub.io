      GetEvent was an endurance sport calendar and registration site. The event registration system was a custom e-commerce application that
      collected participant information defined by event directors as part of the checkout process.
      <br/><br/>
      Event directors relied on the site to manage the participants in their events. Tools to manage those participants and improved reporting
      needed to be built.
      <br/><br/>
      I added web based reports and general functionality in addition to a complete UI overhaul for the GetEvent (previously PreRace.com) site.
      After adding an API, web based reports in event director dashboards and third party JavaScript solutions to display rosters on event websites were
      built.
      <br/><br/>
      The site was built with Bootstrap with heavy dependency on JavaScript/jQuery on top of a CodeIgniter PHP backend.
      <br/><br/>
      Usable and responsive design that made it simple for event directors to get registration data quickly and change it if needed.
